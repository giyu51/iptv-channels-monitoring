# IptvChannelsMonitoring

## Description

üì∫ **iptv-channels-monitoring** is a Python script built using FastAPI and VLC media player that enables monitoring and tracking of IPTV channels' activity and statistics. The script allows you to add and manage multiple channels, providing functionalities such as playing channels ‚ñ∂Ô∏è, updating video frames üñºÔ∏è, retrieving channel statistics üìä, and clearing channel buffers üßπ. It utilizes VLC media player's capabilities to handle various stream types, including HTTP, HTTPS, and UDP. The project aims to provide a convenient solution for monitoring IPTV channels and gathering valuable insights about their performance. üöÄ

## Getting started

To begin with, download the dependencies:

### Dependencies
- Python >= 3.7
- Python packages:
  - FastAPI
  - python-vlc
- VLC media player

#### Debian-based (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian):
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3
sudo apt install python3-pip
pip3 install --upgrade pip
pip3 install fastapi
sudo apt install vlc
pip3 install python-vlc
pip3 install uvicorn
```
 
#### RPM-based (e.g., Fedora, CentOS, Red Hat Enterprise Linux):
```bash
sudo dnf update
sudo dnf install python3
sudo dnf install python3-pip
pip3 install --upgrade pip
pip3 install fastapi
sudo dnf install vlc
pip3 install python-vlc
pip3 install uvicorn
```

### Windows
1. Install Python:
   - Visit the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - Download the latest Python installer for Windows.
   - Run the installer and follow the instructions. Make sure to check the option "Add Python to PATH" during the installation process.

2. Install pip:
   - Open the command prompt.
   - Run the following command to upgrade pip:
     ```
     python -m pip install --upgrade pip
     ```

3. Install FastAPI:
   - Open the command prompt.
   - Run the following command to install FastAPI:
     ```
     pip install fastapi
     ```

4. Install VLC:
   - Visit the [VLC website](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html).
   - Download the VLC installer for Windows.
   - Run the installer and follow the instructions.

5. Install vlc-python:
   - Open the command prompt.
   - Run the following command to install vlc-python:
     ```
     pip install python-vlc
     ```
Please make sure to install these dependencies before running the script. Follow the installation instructions for each dependency based on your operating system.





## Usage

1. **Create a CSV File:** First, create a CSV file named `all_channels.csv` and write the names and links of the channels in the following format: `<channel_name>,<channel_link>` (without any spaces). Here's an example of how it should look:
```csv
DiscoveryScience,http://example.com/DiscoveryScience
Scifi,http://example.com/Scifi
Nickelodeon,http://example.com/Nickelodeon
```


2. **Run the ASGI Server:** Use `uvicorn` to run the ASGI server for the application. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory. 
    Run the following command to start the server:
   - If you want to run the server on the default host and port (localhost:8000), use:
     ```
     uvicorn <your_app_name>:app
     ```

   - If you want to make the server accessible on all interfaces, use:
     ```
     uvicorn <your_app_name>:app --host 0.0.0.0
     ```
   
   - If you want to specify a custom port, use:
     ```
     uvicorn <your_app_name>:app --port <your_port>
     ```

   Replace `<your_app_name>` with the name of your Python application file (without .py).

3. **Access the Application:** Once the server is running, you can access the application by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:8000`   (replace the port number if you specified a custom port).

   The application provides various endpoints for monitoring and interacting with the IPTV channels. Refer to the API documentation or code comments for more details on available endpoints and their functionalities.

Please note that you need to have the required dependencies installed and properly configured before running the application.
