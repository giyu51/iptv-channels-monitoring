# IptvChannelsMonitoring

## Description

üì∫ **iptv-channels-monitoring** is a Python script built using FastAPI and VLC media player that enables monitoring and tracking of IPTV channels' activity and statistics. The script allows you to add and manage multiple channels, providing functionalities such as playing channels ‚ñ∂Ô∏è, updating video frames üñºÔ∏è, retrieving channel statistics üìä, and clearing channel buffers üßπ. It utilizes VLC media player's capabilities to handle various stream types, including HTTP, HTTPS, and UDP. The project aims to provide a convenient solution for monitoring IPTV channels and gathering valuable insights about their performance. üöÄ

Please make sure to install these dependencies before running the script. Follow the installation instructions for each dependency based on your operating system.





## Usage

1. **Create a CSV File:** First, create a CSV file named `all_channels.csv` and write the names and links of the channels in the following format: `<channel_name>,<channel_link>` (without any spaces). Here's an example of how it should look:
```csv
DiscoveryScience,http://example.com/DiscoveryScience
Scifi,http://example.com/Scifi
Nickelodeon,http://example.com/Nickelodeon
```


2. **Run the ASGI Server:** Use `uvicorn` to run the ASGI server for the application. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory. 
    Run the following command to start the server:
   - If you want to run the server on the default host and port (localhost:8000), use:
     ```
     uvicorn <your_app_name>:app
     ```

   - If you want to make the server accessible on all interfaces, use:
     ```
     uvicorn <your_app_name>:app --host 0.0.0.0
     ```
   
   - If you want to specify a custom port, use:
     ```
     uvicorn <your_app_name>:app --port <your_port>
     ```

   Replace `<your_app_name>` with the name of your Python application file (without .py).

3. **Access the Application:** Once the server is running, you can access the application by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:8000`   (replace the port number if you specified a custom port).

   The application provides various endpoints for monitoring and interacting with the IPTV channels. Refer to the API documentation or code comments for more details on available endpoints and their functionalities.

   Following URLs are available:

   - Stats of All Channels: Visit 
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/stats
   ```
    to view the statistics of all channels collectively.

   - Stats of a Specific Channel: To analyze the statistics of a specific channel, replace <channel_name> in the URL 
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/stats/<channel_name>
   ```
    with the desired channel's name.

   - Current Image Frame of a Channel: For accessing the current image frame of a channel, go to 
   
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/screen/<channel_name>
   ```
   Replace <channel_name> with the name of the channel you wish to view.


Please note that you need to have the required dependencies installed and properly configured before running the application.
